After exploring the public demo a bit, feel free to create a private sandbox via the Authentication menu at top.
This provides a fresh instance where a personalized account setup may be created from scratch.

The first account created should be of type 'EQUITY'.  It is common to name the account 'Equity'.  This
is the account which is used to establish all of the starting balances for the other accounts.  You are now the founder
of a business to run your life, complete with all its assets, expenses, revenues, and liabilities.  The Equity account
represents your initial investment in this business -- it is where the money came from before it was sorted out into
things like checking and savings accounts.

Once the Equity account is available, create some ASSET accounts.  The most straightforward examples are cash
accounts like checking and savings.  Add transactions to move money from the EQUITY account into the ASSET accounts to
reflect their starting balances.  If you plan to add historical data, ensure the starting balance reflects the earliest
point desired in the history of the account and that it is dated correctly.  The starting balance transaction should be
the first transaction in the account by transaction date.

LIABILITY accounts are things like credit cards, where you have some sort of line of credit or a loan.  They are
the inverse of ASSET accounts, so starting balances count against your initial investment.  When creating the starting
balance transaction for these accounts, move money from the LIABILITY account to the EQUITY account (the opposite
direction than with ASSET account starting balance transactions).

At this point, you can add transactions to represent cash flows between these accounts, e.g. balance transfers or
credit card / loan payments.  It's time to define REVENUE and EXPENSE accounts to reflect cash flows to and from
external entities.  Transactions in these accounts generally apply against one of your ASSET or LIABILITY accounts
(e.g. paid gas with a credit card, paycheck deposited into checking account).  They typically will not have or need
a starting balance transaction.

	[caution ahead: at time of writing, support for labels and imports has not been fully exposed to users]

There are a couple schools of thought on how to set up your EXPENSE accounts.  Some advocate setting up a separate
account for each counterparty you deal with and use labels.  For example, you could have a separate account for each
grocery store chain you visit so that you see how much you spend at each store, then have all of those transactions
labeled 'groceries' so you can track your overall total separately.  Others prefer to just have one generic 'Groceries'
account (you could, of course, still use labels to track each store if you wanted).  It's up to you.

Once your accounts are set up, they may be used in the 'Import' screen.  Patterns may be defined for each
ASSET and LIABILITY account.  You obtain a copy of each account's transaction history from (your bank here)'s Online
Banking site and feed it in to the importer.  The importer uses the patterns from the 'Import' screen and creates
transactions automatically.  For example, you can set up patterns on your credit card account which match payments
made from your checking account, or match anything with the word 'gas' and associate it with the EXPENSE:Gas account.

<pre>
this is the accounting package
we'll start off with some basic definitions

The Basic Accounting Equation
Assets = Liabilities + Owners' Equity
An org's assets are equal to its equities

typical assets:
cash, accounts receivable, equipment, land, buildings, inventory, investments

equities: claims to assets (e.g. by owners, lenders)

ownership claims to assets are called:
owners' equity if unincorporated
stockholders' equity if a corporation

liabilities: claims of outside parties (banks, suppliers)

balance sheet has assets on the left, liabilities / owners' equity on the right

revenue and expenses impact owners' equity
revenues increase it; expenses reduce it

balances
add up the debits and credits, subtract the smaller from the larger
balance is referred to as debit or credit balance based on which side is larger
Normal Balance Types
Asset		Debit
Liability	Credit
Equity		Credit
Revenue		Credit
Expense		Debit

Trial Balance
a listing of all accounts with their debit and credit balances
prepared at the end of an accounting period
first step in developing financial statements
it's "in balance" when sum of credit balances == sum of debit balances
How to:
Determine the balance of each account
List all accounts, placing debit and credit balances in separate columns
sum debits and credit balances separately
compare the total of the debit and credit columns


Adjustments

Prepaids
You may have noticed that prepaid expenses are listed as assets.  why does that make sense?
This is because the bill hasn't actually come due yet, so no money has been spent yet!
At the end of each accounting period, accruals and adjustments are made which
reflect the actual expense during the period
Example: 4800 for a 2-year insurance policy goes into a prepaid insurance asset account
Each month the bill is 200, so for each monthly accounting period an adjustment
is made which debits an insurance expense account and credits the prepaid insurance asset

Inventory / Cost of Goods Sold
What you bought during the accounting period is not necessarily your cost of goods,
as you started with some inventory and ended up with some
Beginning inventory + purchases - ending inventory = cost of goods
If you end up with more inventory than you started with, then your adjustment will
credit the inventory asset account and debit the cost of goods expense account

Depreciation
annual depreciation = (original cost - salvage value) / useful life expectancy
to record the adjustment, you debit the depreciation expense account and credit the
accumulated depreciation asset account
accumulated depreciation is actually a contra-asset account, which is an asset account
that normally has a credit balance and is used to offset specific asset accounts


Accruals

Payroll
At the end of the month, employees may have worked some time for which they have not yet
been paid.  GAAP says this needs to be reflected in the period where the expense is
incurred.  The adjustment is a debit to the payroll expense account and a credit to the
accrued payroll liability account. related expenses like FICA, unemployment taxes should
be included as it is all money owed.

Interest
like payroll accruals, this is interest expenses for loans incurred during the period
but not paid.  interest = remaining principal * rate * time
time is length of accounting period / days in the year (assuming interest is APR)
The adjustment is a debit to the interest expense account and a credit to the accrued
interest liability account.


Financial statements (post-adjustments)
balance sheet: biz's assets and claims to its assets
income statement: revenues and expenses for the current accounting period
net income and losses are added/deducted from owners' equity prior to preparing the balance sheet
the income statement is based on revenue and expense accounts
those are then closed out to the owners' equity accounts (or retained earnings)
the balance sheet is then based on the asset, liability, and equity accounts

owners' equity withdrawls
owners may withdraw funds for personal use
use a temporary owners' equity account titled (Owner), Withdrawals
this account is not an expense account and should not appear on the income statement
it is closed to the owners' equity account at the end of the period

dividends
a corporation's board of directors may declare a dividend
debit retained earnings and credit dividends payable (liability account)


The accounting cycle

Journalizing
process of analyzing and classifying transactions
most common is the general journal
all adjustments and closing entries are recorded in the general journal

Posting
the recording of debits and credits from journals to the proper accounts
most common and comprehensive is the general ledger, which consists of
accounts for all assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, and expenses

Trial Balance
proves that debits equal credits
conducted just prior to recording adjustments
if the debits and credits are not equal, the reason must be determined
and fixed before making any adjustments

Adjustments
inventory, prepaid expenses, depreciation, accruals
after recording in the journal, they must be posted to the ledger accounts

Adjusted Trial Balance
checks that adjusting entries have been properly posted

Financial Statements
balance sheet and income statement
prepared directly from either the adjusted trial balance or from the ledger accounts
may also prepare other statements like cash flow, retained earnings, etc at this time

Closing Temporary Proprietorship Accounts
record and post the closing entries
revenue, expense, and withdrawal accounts are closed with entries that clear them
so that operating results and withdrawals of the following period can be recorded

Post-Closing Trial Balance
tests the equality of debit and credit accounts again
only has asset, liability, and equity accounts since everything else has been closed

	all transactions affect the basic accounting equation
	there are 9 enumerated types of accounting transactions
		Increase one asset and decrease another asset
			buy equipment: Dr. Equipment, Cr. Cash
		Increase an asset and increase a liability
			borrow cash from the bank: Dr. Cash, Cr. Notes payable
		Increase an asset and increase an owners' equity account
			owner invests in the biz: Dr. Cash, Cr. Owner capital
		Increase one liability and decrease another liability
			a note is made in exchange for an account payable: Dr. Accounts payable, Cr. Notes payable
		Decrease a liability and decrease an asset
			pay a supplier: Dr. Accounts payable, Cr. Cash
		Increase a liability and decrease an owners' equity account
			dividends declared: Dr. Retained earnings and Cr. Dividends payable
		Decrease an asset and decrease an owners' equity account
			owner withdraws cash: Dr. Owner capital and Cr. Cash
		Decrease a liability and increase an owners' equity account
			long-term debt owed to the owner is converted to equity: Dr. Long-term debt, Cr. Owner capital
		Increase an owners' equity account and decrease another owners' equity account
			preferred stock converted to common stock: Dr. preferred, Cr. common

	PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS are those that ONLY:
		increase an asset and decrease a liability
		decrease an asset and increase a liability
		increase a liability and increase an owners' equity account
		decrease a liability and decrease an owners' equity account
		decrease an asset and increase an owners' equity account
		increase an asset and decrease an owners' equity account

	how to determine entries in recording a transaction
		determine which accounts are affected
		determine whether to debit or credit the accounts
		determine the amounts to be recorded

	debits are entries made on the left side of a T account
	credits are entries made on the right side of a T account
	either of these can be an increase or decrease to the account depending on type

	debit/credit (Dr./Cr.) account relationships:
	   ASSETS     LIABILITIES    EQUITY     REVENUES     EXPENSES
	   -------    -----------    -------    ---------    ---------
	    + | -        - | +        - | +       - | +        + | -
	   Dr.|Cr.     Dr. | Cr.     Dr.|Cr.    Dr. | Cr.    Dr. | Cr.

	in a transaction, sum(debits) == sum(credits)

	The six classes of prohibited transactions cannot occur as long as debits
	and credits are balanced with each other.


	IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

	Get a new xact instance and call add_[credit|debit] as appropriate
	to build up the intended effect on the underlying accounts.

	For example, if you buy something for 10k with 7500/2500 loan/cash,
	you debit that asset for 10k, credit the cash account for 2500, and credit
	the loan's liability account for 7500.

	Once all the credits and debits have been entered, you call the save
	method. The transaction will be validated, and it will be passed to the
	various debit/credit methods for the underlying accounts twice.  The first
	time, the commit flag is False, so if there are any issues trying to add
	the data to the account, an appropriate exception will be raised.  If that
	completes ok then the commit flag is turned on and the data is sent again
	for actual storage.
